## A simple, effective phishing‑training program design (reinforce + extend your article)

Below is a concrete software concept you can actually build as a “small but mighty” MVP, plus the specific content areas that matter most (common, sneaky, tricky, high‑impact), and game mechanics that improve learning rather than just making it “fun.”

I’m grounding the core focus in your article’s biggest takeaways: (1) phishing + pretexting dominate real breaches , (2) people act *fast* (seconds) , and (3) attackers exploit predictable human psychology (authority/urgency/familiarity/social proof) .

## What the software should *actually* train (behavior, not trivia)

Most phishing training accidentally optimizes for: “Can you spot a sloppy fake email?”
Real attackers often win by getting a busy person to do a *workflow action* (approve, pay, reset, share, install, grant permission) in a moment of pressure—sometimes **without any link at all** (classic BEC/pretexting) .

So the program should train these three behaviors:

1. **Pause + inspect** (break the “21 seconds to click” habit). Your article notes users click in ~21 seconds and complete compromise in <1 minute . Your app should make “pause” the first skill, not an afterthought.
2. **Classify the *request*, not the vibe** (money/credentials/access/permissions/download).
3. **Verify via a *known* channel, then report** (not “reply to the email and ask if it’s real”). Your article emphasizes verifying the source using a verified contact method  and using separate channels/verification protocols for high‑stakes requests .

That means the “correct answer” is often **not** “phish/not phish.” It’s:
**“What is the safest next action?”**

## Program concept: **Inbox Arena** (a realistic inbox triage game)

### Elevator pitch

Learners play as a “Trust & Safety Analyst” processing an inbox across email + SMS + calls/voicemail transcripts. Their goal isn’t “spot the phish” in the abstract—it’s to **protect the organization while keeping work moving**.

This is important because over‑aggressive “everything is suspicious” behavior is also harmful (false positives). Training should build *discrimination*, not paranoia.

### Core loop (MVP)

Each round (“Shift”) gives the learner 8–12 messages. For each message they choose one action:

* **Report** (to security / spam / IT)
* **Delete / Ignore**
* **Verify** (call known number, open official portal manually, check internal directory, ask a colleague via Teams, etc.)
* **Proceed** (approve, pay, click, open, login, download, grant permission)

Then they immediately see:

* Outcome (safe / compromised / delayed work / false alarm)
* What cues mattered (highlighted)
* A one‑minute “why” explanation tied to the article’s concepts (urgency, spoofing, pretexting, etc.)

## The “tricky + important” content to prioritize (your curriculum backbone)

Your article cites Verizon DBIR 2024: **phishing + pretexting account for 73% of breaches** across social engineering . So your game should heavily weight these two families, then add modern variants.

### Level set A: Phishing fundamentals (but done right)

Focus on the cues from your article, but teach them as a *routine*:

* Urgent/threatening language 
* Generic greeting 
* Domain/email mismatches 
* Spelling/grammar errors (still relevant, but no longer reliable as a primary cue) 
* Unexpected attachment/link + hover to inspect URLs 

**Key twist for “sneaky”**: by mid‑game, the phishing emails become perfectly written. Learners must rely on **process cues** (verification, domain inspection, request analysis), not “bad writing.”

Also: your article notes most phishing is via email (over 90%) and a large share of attacks begin with phishing . Early levels can be email‑heavy, but don’t stay there.

### Level set B: Pretexting + BEC (the “no link” attacks)

This is where training programs usually underperform.

Your article’s BEC section is gold for scenario design: attackers pose as executives/vendors, target finance/admin roles, research context, and push urgent actions (wire, gift cards, sensitive info) .

**Design principle:** many BEC scenarios should have **no suspicious link**. The “tell” is the mismatch between:

* the request and normal process,
* the urgency,
* and verification channel.

Your article also explains why pretexting works: authority bias, urgency, familiarity, social proof . Build levels that explicitly teach these triggers.

**Impact framing:** BEC remains extremely costly. Your article cites 2023 IC3 losses of $2.9B , and the FBI’s 2024 IC3 report lists BEC losses of about **$2.77B**  (with phishing/spoofing among the highest complaint categories ). The goal isn’t to scare learners—it’s to justify why “verify first” is rational.

### Level set C: Spoofing + look‑alike identities (easy to miss)

Your article defines spoofing as altering identifiers (email, sender names, phone numbers, URLs), often changing one character .

**Game mechanic:** give learners a “Lens” tool that reveals the underlying address/URL/Reply‑To. The trick is that they must choose to use it—training the habit.

### Level set D: Multi‑channel phishing (smishing/vishing + “wrong number” scam)

NIST emphasizes phishing doesn’t only arrive via email—also texts, calls, social media, even mail ([NIST][1]). Your article also lists phishing variations (vishing, smishing, etc.) .

**Must‑include scenario:** your article’s “wrong number text” scam, which starts friendly and later introduces crypto investment or info requests . This is perfect for a *multi‑turn* simulation (the learner sees 4–6 texts over time and decides where to cut it off).

### Level set E: “Modern sneaky” (post‑2020 patterns learners are *not* intuitively ready for)

These are high‑leverage expansions beyond your article:

1. **QR code phishing (“quishing”)**
   Official UK reporting warns about rogue QR codes and significant reported losses ([Action Fraud][2]).
   Training point: “A QR code is just a link you can’t easily preview—treat it as high risk unless it’s from a verified context.”

2. **OAuth/consent phishing (legit login page, still a trap)**
   This is one of the most conceptually tricky patterns because the sign‑in page is hosted by a legitimate identity provider. Microsoft explains that attackers trick users into granting permissions to malicious apps; tokens can then be used to access mail/files without further user action ([Microsoft][3]).
   Training point: “The danger isn’t only ‘fake login pages.’ It’s also ‘real consent prompts for untrusted apps.’”

3. **AI‑boosted phishing**
   Verizon’s 2025 DBIR executive summary notes synthetically generated text in malicious emails has **doubled over the past two years** (per a partner dataset) .
   Training point: learners must stop treating “grammar quality” as a safety signal.

## Game mechanics that improve learning (not just engagement)

Here are mechanics with strong rationale and minimal complexity.

### 1) **Scoring based on decision quality, not speed**

Because attackers exploit urgency , speed‑based points can train the wrong reflex. Instead:

* Points for **choosing a safe action** (report/verify/delete when appropriate)
* Penalty for **high‑risk actions** (click, download, approve MFA, pay, grant permissions)
* Separate penalty for **false positives** (reporting legitimate messages unnecessarily)
* Bonus for **using verification channels correctly** (e.g., “open vendor portal manually” vs “use the link in the email”)

### 2) **A “Verification Budget” (light game theory, high realism)**

Give each shift 2–3 “Verification Tokens.” Verifying consumes one token but reduces risk.

This creates a realistic tradeoff:

* You can’t “verify everything,” so you must learn which *requests* deserve verification (money, credentials, access, permissions).
* Learners practice triage under limited attention—closer to the real workplace.

### 3) **Confidence calibration (teaches humility + better reporting)**

After each decision, learners rate confidence (e.g., 50–100%).
The system tracks “high confidence wrong answers” as the most dangerous category and adapts.

This is pedagogically powerful and easy to implement.

### 4) **Immediate feedback + highlighted cues**

After an answer, show:

* “These 3 phrases were urgency bait.”
* “Here is the look‑alike domain.”
* “Here is the dangerous permission request.”

Then ask one follow‑up question:
**“Which single clue would you check first next time?”**
That builds retrieval practice with minimal extra time.

### 5) **Adaptive practice using the NIST Phish Scale**

NIST’s Phish Scale is designed to rate phishing detection difficulty and interpret training results ([NIST][4]). Use it in two ways:

* Each scenario gets a difficulty label (internally).
* The system increases difficulty only when learners show stability on easier cues.

This prevents the common failure mode: learners get crushed by advanced examples early and disengage.

### 6) Borrow what works from proven phishing games (without copying them)

The “Anti‑Phishing Phil” research found short gameplay improved people’s ability to identify fraudulent sites more than reading tutorials, with reported accuracy improving substantially after gameplay ([CMU School of Computer Science][5]). Later serious‑game research also evaluates different mechanics for anti‑phishing learning games ([International Journal of Serious Games][6]).

You can adopt the *principle* (interactive decisions + feedback) without adopting the fish theme.

## Concrete feature spec for a “simple but great” MVP

### Learner screens

1. **Inbox Screen**

   * List of messages (email + SMS tabs)
   * Quick preview (sender, subject, snippet)
   * “Risk meter” (hidden until after action, to prevent gaming)

2. **Message Detail Screen**

   * Full message view
   * Hover‑to‑preview URLs (or tap‑and‑hold on mobile)
   * “Inspect” panel: shows actual sender email, reply‑to, link targets, attachment details, QR decode result (for QR scenarios)
   * Action buttons: Report / Delete / Verify / Proceed

3. **Feedback Screen**

   * Result
   * Cues highlighted in text
   * “Best next action” explanation
   * One micro‑question (retrieval practice)

4. **Progress Screen**

   * Skill badges (Domain Detective, Verification Pro, BEC Blocker)
   * Mistake patterns (“You miss domain mismatches most often”)
   * Streaks based on “safe decisions,” not speed

### Instructor screens

1. **Cohort Dashboard**

   * Accuracy vs false positives
   * Report rate (how often learners correctly choose “report”)
   * Top missed cues (e.g., “Reply‑To mismatch,” “permission request”)
2. **Assignment Builder**

   * Choose modules (Basics, BEC, Smishing, Quishing, OAuth)
   * Set target difficulty range (via Phish Scale)
3. **Debrief Pack Generator**

   * Exports 5–10 anonymized “teachable moments” for class discussion

## Scenario library design (this is where effectiveness lives)

A scenario isn’t just text. It’s a structured object:

* **Channel:** email / SMS / call transcript / Teams message
* **User role:** student / staff / finance / faculty / IT
* **Legitimacy:** legit / suspicious‑but‑legit / malicious
* **Attack family:** phishing / pretexting(BEC) / tech support / wrong‑number / QR / OAuth
* **Primary risk:** credential theft / malware / payment fraud / data leakage / account takeover
* **Cues present:** (tag list)
* **Correct action:** report/delete/verify/proceed
* **Why:** explanation and what to do IRL
* **Difficulty:** NIST Phish Scale score

**Important:** include “suspicious but legit” messages so learners don’t learn “anything urgent is phishing.” Real organizations do send urgent things; the difference is process and verification.

## Five example scenarios (safe, generic, and built for teaching)

These are *training sketches* you can convert into JSON templates.

### 1) Classic credential phish (easy)

**Email:** “Your account will be suspended in 24 hours…” (urgency)
**Trick:** Link text looks normal; URL is slightly off (spoofing)
**Correct action:** Report + delete, then go to the official site manually if worried
**Teaches:** urgency cue , domain mismatch , hover/inspect 

### 2) BEC “gift cards for a client” (harder, no link)

**Email from:** “Dr. A. Person (CEO)”
**Request:** “Need 10 gift cards ASAP, I’m in meetings—text me the codes.”
**Correct action:** Verify through known channel + follow finance policy; report
**Teaches:** authority + urgency , BEC patterns 

### 3) Reply‑chain hijack (very tricky)

**Email thread:** Looks like an ongoing vendor conversation
**Twist:** Reply‑To is different; attachment is “updated payment form”
**Correct action:** Verify by contacting vendor using known info, not email thread
**Teaches:** familiarity bias , spoofing mechanics 

### 4) QR code “account verification” (modern)

**Poster/email:** “Scan to confirm benefits enrollment”
**Twist:** QR code resolves to look‑alike domain
**Correct action:** Don’t scan; go to official portal manually; report if suspicious
**Teaches:** quishing risk (QR codes used for phishing) ([Action Fraud][2])

### 5) OAuth consent phish (conceptually hardest)

**Email:** “New secure document shared—sign in to view”
**Flow:** Link goes to a legitimate login, then a consent prompt requesting broad permissions
**Correct action:** Do not grant; report; if needed request doc via official system
**Teaches:** consent phishing—real IdP page, malicious permissions ([Microsoft][3])

---

## Measurement: how you’ll know it’s working

At minimum, track four outcome metrics:

1. **True positive rate** (catching real phish)
2. **False positive rate** (over‑reporting legit work)
3. **“Unsafe action rate”** (click/open/proceed on malicious)
4. **Verification behavior rate** (do they choose verify when stakes are high?)

Then do:

* **Pre‑test → training → post‑test**
* **Delayed post‑test** (retention), because the point is habit formation, not short‑term recall.

Use NIST’s Phish Scale as your difficulty lens so improvements aren’t misread when you change scenario difficulty ([NIST][4]).

---

## Implementation notes (keep it simple, keep it safe)

### Suggested stack (minimal complexity)

* Frontend: React (or any framework)
* Backend: lightweight API (Node/Express or Python/FastAPI)
* Data: JSON scenario pack + small DB for results (SQLite/Postgres)

### Safety/ethics requirements (non‑negotiable)

* Use **fictional domains** (example.com, internal.training) and fictional org names
* Never collect real credentials; never embed real login pages
* Make “proceed” actions simulated only (no real network calls)
* Don’t auto‑generate “convincing real‑brand phishing emails” with an LLM; if using generation, enforce templates where you *must* include explicit teachable cues and you label them internally.

---

## Why this design aligns with your article (and improves it)

* You’re concentrating training on the patterns that matter most: phishing + pretexting dominate breaches .
* You’re training the human timing problem: compromise can happen in under a minute .
* You’re explicitly teaching the psychological levers (authority/urgency/familiarity/social proof) rather than pretending people fail because they’re “careless” .
* You’re expanding into modern realities: AI‑polished phish , QR scams ([Action Fraud][2]), and OAuth consent phishing ([Microsoft][3]).

---

## If you want one decisive “north star” rule to bake into the UI

Whenever a message asks for **money, credentials, access, installs, or permissions**, the UI should push learners into:

**STOP → INSPECT → VERIFY (known channel) → REPORT/PROCEED**

That single routine, repeated across dozens of scenarios, is the habit you’re trying to automate.

---

If you tell me your target audience (e.g., college students, staff, K‑12 teachers, finance team) and the environment (Gmail/Outlook, Slack/Teams, mobile‑heavy or desktop‑heavy), I can propose a tight **first 30‑scenario “starter pack”** with difficulty progression and an instructor debrief plan—still simple, but extremely targeted.

**Confidence:** High on the instructional/game design approach and the “what to train” priorities; high on all cited factual claims; moderate on any uncited generalizations about specific org workflows (since those vary widely).
